        "## About the dataset\n",

        "\n",
        "## How to get the data\n",
        "\n",
        "There are multiple ways to get this dataset, but one of the most convenient is to use [scikit-learn's datasets](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_iris.html#sklearn.datasets.load_iris). It is ok if you are not familiar with scikit-learn - it is already installed by default on Google Colab and you only need to use one function to get the data. We recommend using this approach, because it is relatively simple, but if you are comfortable with an alternative (e.g., loading this dataset from Kaggle, GitHub, TensorFlow, etc.) or would like to experiment a bit more you are free to do use alternative ways to get the data.\n",

        "\n",
        "You will need to use what you learned in the \"Big Ideas and Little Code in Python Lesson 4: Implementing k-means Unsupervised Machine Learning\" lesson and implement your k-means clustering algorithm. If you know how to use a library (e.g., scikit-learn, scipy, etc.) to implement the k-means algorithm and would like to see if your implementation provides similar clusters, we encourage you to try to use it only *after* you have implemented the algorithm yourself. \n",

        "\n",
        "## Clusters vs. labels\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset also provides a `labels` column (feature). To understand if your clusters make sense, you should see the distributions of the labels in each of your clusters. This will help you debug your code and evaluate the performance of your algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Visualizations and tools\n",
        "\n",
        "If you have experience working with visualization libraries (e.g., matplotlib, seaborn, etc.) or libraries used for data manipulation (e.g., NumPy, pandas, etc.) feel free to use them in your project. Using these tools is not a requirement and won't get you any additional points, so don't try to use any tool that you don't feel comfortable with."

A good way to do that is to open the GitHub link to your repository (available in the Turing Platform) instead of the Google Colab one, or by simply refreshing the platform and checking if the notebook preview has your updates. If you see the changes there, you are good to go! Note that reviewers are allowed to only evaluate the work that you have submitted,and that once you submit your project, you are no longer allowed to make any changes, so this step is really important.\n",

The platform then allows you to see the times when reviewers are available to have a call with you and review the project. Simply book a time that suits you. If there are no times available, feel free to message us in the [#education_support](https://discord.com/channels/722762519911071744/769151570687688704) channel on Discord — we will make sure that a reviewer adds a time for you.\n",

        "\n",
        "The most common structure for a code review is for the learner to go through their project while sharing their screen, presenting how each part was done and what insights were achieved. The reviewer asks questions to check whether the learner really understands the relevant parts of the project, and assigns a rating from 1 to 5 for each of the evaluation criteria. On average, a review like this takes 30 minutes to complete, but the time can differ based on the project and amount of feedback.\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of a correction is to test the current limits of your knowledge and give you personalised feedback on how to improve further. Expect the reviewer to give you tips on how to improve things, even if you did everything perfectly according to the criteria. We also very strongly advise you to let the reviewer know if you feel unsure about some parts of your knowledge, instead of trying to hide it — this is the best way to improve as the reviewer will be able to confirm or reject your assumptions, while you will not be losing anything by potentially getting a lower score.\n",
        "\n",
        "To pass a correction and unlock the next sprint, you need to achieve a score of 70% or more. If you fail the project, you will be given write access to your repository once again and will be expected to make adjustments based on the feedback received. Once the changes are made, you will be able to submit the project once again and schedule a new code review — as mentioned before, a low score, even a failing one, is nothing to worry about, as you will be able to move forward as soon as you are ready to do so.\n",
